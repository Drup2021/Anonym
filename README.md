# Anonym

Anonym is a Next.js application built with TypeScript that enables users to send and receive anonymous messages seamlessly. To enhance user engagement, it integrates the Google Gemini API for generating fun and witty questions. 

The application addresses a **critical challenge faced by anonymous messaging platformsâ€”ensuring user safety**. It incorporates a **dedicated Safe Mode** that effectively **filters harmful or abusive content**, tackling issues like **extortion, blackmail, and the transmission of harmful or explicit messages**.

Anonym provides two core interfaces: one for users to view received messages and another for sending anonymous messages. Authentication is securely managed using **NextAuth**, ensuring user privacy and data protection.

## Features

- **Anonymous Messaging**: Users can send and receive anonymous messages.
- **LLM Integration**: Generates random prompts or questions using the Gemini Flash 2.0 API.
- **Safe Mode(Harmful Content Monitoring): Classifies content into whether it is harmful or not and does not allow harmful messages to be sent in safe mode.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication with NextAuth.
- **User Interfaces**: Separate interfaces for sending and receiving messages.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
